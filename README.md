# Elemental Wands
A Minecraft 1.18.2 forge mod made with MCreator and Blockbench.

The mod adds mobs, resources and 4 elemental wands: Forest, Fire, Water and Air.
Wands are crafted with different resources and shards which are dropped from added fairies that inhabit biomes in relation to their elemental shard cores.
You can get the cores by either killing them or feeding amethyst shards which will let you keep fairies alive.
